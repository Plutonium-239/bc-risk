# Breast Cancer Risk Prediction
This repository contains the code and other related outut files like plots, cross-validation results etc. for the **SURA Project** under [**Prof. Ishaan Gupta**](https://sites.google.com/view/fungel-iitd/home) 

All model building and analysis was done in Python by [**Yukti Makhija**](https://github.com/yuktimakhija) and [**Samarth Bhatia**](https://github.com/Plutonium-239).

The preprocessing code is in the [`/preproc`](/preproc) folder, using different algorithms like [PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html), [tSNE](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html), [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [KPrototypes](https://github.com/nicodv/kmodes)

The plots are in the [`/plots`](/plots) folder. Used [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/python/) and the `matplotlib.pyplot` library.

The calculator web-app was built using Dash and is available at [website](), and the code is in the [`/app`](/app) folder.
